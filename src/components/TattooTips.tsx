          <strong className="text-stone-900 dark:text-stone-100">Check reviews and ratings.</strong>{" "}
          Google ratings and review counts are a great starting point. Look for shops with
          consistently high ratings and a large number of reviews for the most reliable picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-stone-900 dark:text-stone-100">Review portfolios.</strong>{" "}
          Every reputable tattoo artist maintains a portfolio. Visit their website or social media
          to see examples of their work, especially in the style you want.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-stone-900 dark:text-stone-100">Consider specializations.</strong>{" "}
          Different artists excel in different styles — from traditional and Japanese to fine line
          and realism. Choose a shop where artists specialize in the style you&apos;re looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-stone-900 dark:text-stone-100">Visit the shop first.</strong>{" "}
          A clean, professional environment is essential. Look for proper sterilization equipment,
          individually packaged needles, and a generally welcoming atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-stone-900 dark:text-stone-100">Ask about pricing upfront.</strong>{" "}
          Most shops charge by the hour or by the piece. Get a clear quote before starting and
          understand the shop&apos;s deposit and cancellation policies.
